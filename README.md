Qimen Dunjia (simplified Chinese: 奇门遁甲; traditional Chinese: 奇門遁甲) is an ancient form of divination from China, which is still in use in China, Taiwan, Singapore and the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Qimen Dunjia may be applied to business, crime-solving, marriages and matchmaking, medical divination, Feng Shui, military affairs, finding missing people, travel, personal fortune divination etc.

This project is an efficient algorithm to correctly complete divination setup, based on the ancient calender. This algorithm can be integreted easily with GUIs.
